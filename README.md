# Jackson The Mighty

A game designed for a friend. Allowed me to dive into Unity's 2D Environment. Basic side scrolling "Super Hero" game.
Developed in 14 days, this project allowed me to grasp a better understanding of how Unity's 2D sprite systems works.
As well as the bulit in physics2D engine. This project was purely for fun and VERY unoptimized.
